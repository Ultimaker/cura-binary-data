<h4>Default is now Balanced</h4>
<p>For this release our Print Profile Experts have evaluated years of research resulting in the UltiMaker profiles and recalibrated them. With these insights the visual, engineering and draft profiles work better than before, and we now offer as a default profile strikes a better balance between the three. To reflect the perfect harmony between these three elements, we updated the default profile, named “Balanced”. With these changes you can now choose from Visual, Engineering, or Balanced profiles for more materials and when using 0.8 mm print cores in order to get great results that match your needs.</p>
