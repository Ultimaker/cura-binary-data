<h4>Default is now Balanced</h4>
<p>Our Print Profile Experts, using years of research and experience, recalibrated the UltiMaker profiles. With these insights the Visual, Engineering and Draft profiles work better than before, and we now offer a default profile that strikes a better balance between the three. To reflect the perfect harmony between these three intents, we updated the default profile to “Balanced”. With these changes you can now choose intents for more materials in order to get great results that match your needs. <a href="https://support.ultimaker.com/s/article/1667411132905">Learn more about our intent profiles here</a></p>
