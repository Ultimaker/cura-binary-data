<h4>Keep printing over cloud – quick action needed</h4>
<p>A quick heads-up for anyone using Digital Factory to print over the cloud. To keep things running smoothly, you may need to update to a workspace. We made some changes for non-subscribed users in November 2023, and if you haven’t updated yet, now’s the time! <a href="https://digitalfactory.ultimaker.com/app/workspace/about?utm_source=cura&utm_medium=software&utm_campaign=whats-new-upgrade">Just click here</a> or check your account settings—it should only take a few seconds and does not require a paid subscription. If you have already joined someone else's workspace without upgrading your account, you may still need to make a workspace. <a href="https://support.ultimaker.com/s/article/000002955">Please follow these support instructions to find out how! </a></p>
