<h4>Approve print jobs created by ‘Guests’ before the printer starts</h4>
<p>When you have an Ultimaker Professional, Excellence, or Education subscriptions you can assign ‘Guest’ roles. Colleagues or students in a ‘Guest’ role can prepare print jobs in Ultimaker Cura and send them to printers via the Ultimaker Digital Factory. Print jobs prepared like this will not start immediately but will require approval from a user with the 'Member' or 'Admin' roles. <a href="https://support.ultimaker.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021165259?utm_source=cura&utm_medium=software&utm_campaign=whats_new_52">Learn more about the available roles in an organization here</a>. </p>
