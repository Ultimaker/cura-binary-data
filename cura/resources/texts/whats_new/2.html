<h4>Connected printers are now bundled by abstract printer types</h4>
<p>Your connected Ultimaker printers are now automatically bundled by printer type. You can select this abstract printer type when you start slicing your part. You can now see the loaded materials of all printers without selecting each individual printer. When you are finished slicing you can send it to one or multiple of your connected printers. </a></p>
