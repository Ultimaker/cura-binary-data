<h4>Duplicate and organize models on your build plate more easily</h4>
<p>Itâ€™s now possible to use Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to copy and paste models within Cura for easier and more intuitive model duplication. You can also arrange models on the build plate in a grid formation to more easily fill up and organize your build plate when printing multiple parts.</p>
