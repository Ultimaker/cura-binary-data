<h4>Upcoming changes for USB-connected printing </H4>
<p>In Cura 5.11, USB printing will no longer be enabled by default. New users will need to enable USB printing manually if they wish to use it. Anyone who printed using USB in Cura 5.10 can continue printing as normal. We have added the ‘Enable/Disable USB Printing’ setting to the preference menu to help with this change. Note that this refers to having your PC and printer directly linked via a USB cable, not printing with a USB hard drive.<p>
