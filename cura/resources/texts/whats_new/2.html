<h4>Happy Holidays from us to you</h4>
<p>Without our contributor’s help, it wouldn’t be possible for Cura to support this many settings and 3D printers. Every now and then we receive a contribution that spectacularly changes how Cura works, like the one from Thomas. We believe this is an awesome example of how opensource software can thrive. <a href="https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/discussions">If you have any feedback to improve tree supports, you can help us by reporting it here on our GitHub.</a> Finally, we would like to wish you Happy Holiday Season from the UltiMaker Cura team.</p>
