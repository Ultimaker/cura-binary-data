<h4>Automatic failed slicing analysis</h4>
<p>A new tool has been added in this release that helps to more easily analyze and diagnose the reason for a failed slice. Now, when a crash happens during slicing, a report is automatically sent to our support team for analysis. The team has been working hard on reducing the number of crashes, and also introduced some changes that should significantly reduce how often they show up.</p>
