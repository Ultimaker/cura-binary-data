<h4>Support for the 3D SpaceMouse by 3Dconnexion</h4>
<p> Support for the SpaceMouse has been added in this release. Commonly used in CAD and 3D design software, a 3D mouse makes working with 3D models more precise and efficient. The SpaceMouse, along with the CadMouse, are a perfect fit for Cura and should help make your 3D printing workflows more efficient, especially when switching between Cura and CAD or design software. A big thanks to 3Dconnexions for helping to make this integration possible! </p>
