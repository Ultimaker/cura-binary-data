<h4>Support added for the new UltiMaker S8</h4>
<p>The UltiMaker S8 is supported in Cura. The S8 is one of the newest professional desktop printers in the S series, and it achieves up to 4x the speed of its predecessor while also improving print quality. That is possible thanks to the new UltiMaker Cheetah motion planner and new high flow cores, all of which will be usable at launch with Cura! <a href="https://ultimaker.com/3d-printers/s-series/ultimaker-s8/?utm_source=whatsnew&utm_medium=cura&utm_campaign=510">Learn more about this printer here</a>.</p>
