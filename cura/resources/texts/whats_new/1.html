<h4>New brims are easier to remove</h4>
<p>The order that brims are printed in has been tweaked so that they are now easier to remove. If you have been avoiding using brims in the past because of how hard they are to remove, make sure to enable the Smart Brim setting and give them another go. You can now look forward to easier brim removal and less (or no) brim material left behind on your final part. <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6080908?utm_source=whatsnew&utm_medium=cura&utm_campaign=54_beta"> Visit our Thingiverse page to download this cookie cutter to try the smart brim for yourself</a>.</p>
