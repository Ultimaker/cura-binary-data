<h4>Powerful new engine plugins</h4>
<p> Plugins from the Marketplace have now gained the ability to interact with the Cura slicing engine in ways that allow plugins to fundamentally modify how Cura works. Plugins can now add new settings, modify existing settings, and change how Cura behaves when slicing a model. As an example Cura is now shipped with the CuraEngineGradualFlow plug-in, that introduces settings that can prevent sudden flow jumps when transitioning between flows, but from now on you can slowly expect engine plugins to show up on the marketplace. </p>
