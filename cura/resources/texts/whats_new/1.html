<h4>Improved print quality and better brims</h4>
<p>A number of settings have been tuned to provide better print quality. Z seams should now be aligned more evenly when printing using the ‘Sharpest Corner’ setting and selecting  ‘None’ as the Seam Corner Preference. Supports will also now generate more reliably and with fewer unneeded support structures. Brims will print faster and should be easier to remove, and concentric top and bottom lines are now printed in the correct order.</p>
