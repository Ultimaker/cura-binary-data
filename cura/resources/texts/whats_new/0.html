<h4>New scarf seam settings for a less prominent Z seam</h4>
<p>Three new experimental settings have been added for turning your Z seam into a scarf seam. A scarf seam is created by varying the flow rate at the start and end of a line to merge the seam together, reducing the prominent bump of a traditional seam. It is named after the scarf joint used in woodworking. The settings are Scarf Seam Length, Scarf Seam Start Height, and Scarf Seam Split Distance</p>
