<h4>Updated tree supports use less material and print faster</h4>
<p>Improved tree supports now use less material and print faster, making them easier to remove and resulting in a cleaner final print. If you downloaded our previous Xmas tree support alpha, then Xmas has come again thanks to you and everyone else who helped us test and refine these supports. Also a big shout out to community member Thomas Rahm who originally proposed and created these new improvements.<a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6069926?utm_source=whatsnew&utm_medium=cura&utm_campaign=54_beta"> Visit our Thingiverse page to download this amazing dragon pencil holder to try the supports for yourself</a>.</p>
