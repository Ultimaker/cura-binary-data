<h4>Open print files directly from Thingiverse</h4>
<p>You can now open files in Cura directly from Thingiverse with a single click. You can find a “Open in Cura” button on all compatible file types which includes models that use the STL, 3MF, and OBJ file extension. Doing so will load the file into Cura just as if you had downloaded it and opened it normally with the added advantage that your downloads folder will not get clogged. <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/?utm_campaign=57&utm_medium=cura&utm_source=whatsnew">Visit Thingiverse to try it out for yourself.</a></p>
